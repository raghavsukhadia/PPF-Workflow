Absolutely — let’s turn your PPF center workflow into a clean, mobile-friendly management system you can build on Replit.

## 1) What your web app should do (end-to-end)

You want a “job card” system where **each vehicle becomes one Job**, and that job moves through your stages:

**Vehicle Inward → Inspection → Washing → Surface Preparation → Parts Opening → Washing (2) → PPF → Parts Repacking → Cleaning & Finishing → Final Inspection → Delivered**

For each stage, the app should support:

* **Start / Complete** button (with timestamp + who did it)
* **Notes + photos** (very important for inspection + quality proof)
* **Checklist** (so nothing is missed)
* **Quality flags** (e.g., “Issue found” → create a rework task)

---

## 2) Roles (who uses it)

Keep it simple:

* **Admin/Owner**: full access, pricing, reports, users
* **Service Advisor / Front Desk**: creates job, customer details, updates status
* **Technicians**: only see jobs assigned to them, update stage checklists/photos
* **QC (Final Inspector)**: only final inspection + approve delivery

---

## 3) Core screens (mobile-friendly)

### A) Dashboard

* Today’s jobs
* Jobs in progress (by stage)
* Pending delivery
* Delayed jobs (stuck too long in a stage)

### B) Create Job (Vehicle Inward)

Fields:

* Customer name, phone, WhatsApp
* Vehicle: brand/model/year/color
* VIN / Reg no. / Odometer
* Package: Full body / Partial / PPF + Ceramic, etc.
* Promised delivery date/time
* Advance paid + payment mode
* Before photos (front/back/left/right/roof)

### C) Job Card (the main page)

Shows:

* Progress timeline (your 11 steps)
* Each step opens a page with checklist + photos + notes
* Assign technician for next steps
* “Rework/Issue” button
* Customer communication log (optional but useful)

### D) Kanban Board (super useful)

Columns = your stages
Cards = vehicles
Drag/drop to next stage (or “Move Next” button)

### E) Delivered + Invoice

* Final QC checklist
* Customer signature (simple touch signature on mobile)
* Balance payment
* Delivery photos

## 4) Data structure you should use (simple + scalable)

### Tables/Collections

**Users**

* id, name, role, phone, pin/password

**Customers**

* id, name, phone, address(optional)

**Vehicles**

* id, customer_id, reg_no, model, color, vin

**Jobs**

* id, job_no, vehicle_id
* current_stage (1–11)
* status (active/hold/delivered/cancelled)
* promised_date
* package, price, advance, balance
* created_at

**JobStages** (one record per stage per job)

* id, job_id, stage_name, stage_no
* started_at, completed_at
* assigned_to (user_id)
* checklist_json
* notes
* photos (array of URLs)

**Issues/Rework**

* id, job_id, stage_no
* issue_type, description, photos, resolved

This structure keeps everything clean.

## 6) Tech stack for Replit (fast + easy)

If you want “proper management system” but still simple to build:

**Frontend**

* Next.js (mobile-friendly UI)
* TailwindCSS
* PWA support (can “install” on phone)

**Backend**

* Next.js API routes (simple) OR Express

**Database**

* SQLite (quick start) + Prisma ORM
  (Later you can move to Postgres without rewriting much)

**Auth**

* Simple login (role-based)

**File upload**

* Cloudinary (best for photos) or Supabase Storage

### Phase 1 (Must-have in 1st version)

* Login + roles
* Create job
* Job card with 11 steps
* Checklists + notes
* Status tracking + timestamps

## 8) I can help you build it step-by-step (starting now)

Next message, tell me **one thing** (only this) so I can generate the full blueprint + database schema + UI pages:

**Do you want this to be for only your staff (internal app), or also for customers to track status?**

If you say “internal only”, I’ll reply with:

* Exact pages list
* Database schema (Prisma)
* Stage checklist JSON format
* Replit-ready project structure
* First working code for “Create Job + Job Card + Move to Next Stage”
